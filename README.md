###### NOTICE: This project will soon be transitioning to a new project that better satisfies C++ and Linux coding guidelines. This will make the library eligible for incorporation into an established library like boost.

AsioExpress is a framework for developing applications using the boost asio library. It has everything you need to quickly get an asio based application up and running so that you can focus on the application logic and not the asio plumbing. AsioExpress provides a number of classes to extend the feature set of asio. It strives to fit alongside the asio library and it tries not to limit access to any features.

Features include: robust error handling, TCP client/server API, IPC client/server API, synchronization primitives, extended timer support, async logging, internal services, and coroutine support.
